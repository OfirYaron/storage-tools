# Storage Tools - Development Roadmap

## Project Vision
Build a comprehensive file and folder management tool that helps users analyze, organize, and optimize their storage usage efficiently.

---

## Core Features

### 1. Folder Analysis (Disk Usage & Statistics)

**Goal**: Provide detailed insights into folder size, file counts, and storage distribution.

#### Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Basic Analysis**
- Traverse directory tree and calculate sizes
- Count files and subdirectories
- Display total size, file count, and folder count
- Support for human-readable size formatting (KB, MB, GB, TB)

**Phase 2: Advanced Statistics**
- File type distribution (count and size by extension)
- Largest files within the analyzed folder
- Deepest nested paths
- Average file size
- Date-based analysis (modification/creation dates)
- Permission analysis (readable/writable counts)

**Phase 3: Visualization**
- Tree-view output with sizes
- Progress bars for size distribution
- Optional JSON/CSV export for further analysis

#### Technical Considerations

**Efficiency:**
- Use `os.scandir()` instead of `os.listdir()` for better performance
- Implement iterative traversal instead of recursive to avoid stack overflow on deep directories
- Consider async I/O for large directory trees
- Cache results for repeated queries
- Add option to follow/ignore symbolic links (avoid infinite loops)
- Implement depth limit to prevent excessive traversal

**Reusability:**
- Create `storage_tools/analyzer.py` module
- Classes:
  - `FolderAnalyzer`: Main analysis engine
  - `StorageStats`: Data class for holding statistics
  - `FileTypeAnalyzer`: Extension-specific analysis
- Separate traversal logic from calculation logic
- Make output formatters pluggable (console, JSON, CSV)

**Caveats:**
- Handle permission errors gracefully (log and continue)
- Deal with special files (devices, sockets, named pipes)
- Consider filesystem-specific issues (case sensitivity on macOS/Windows)
- Handle extremely large directories (millions of files)
- Account for sparse files (actual vs. apparent size)
- Consider hard links (count once, not multiple times)
- Network drives may be slow - add timeout options
- Handle Unicode filenames properly
- Consider exclusive file access issues (open files)

**CLI Interface:**
```bash
storage-tools analyze <path> [options]
  --depth N              # Limit traversal depth
  --min-size SIZE        # Filter by minimum size
  --sort-by {size,name,count}  # Sort results
  --format {table,json,csv}    # Output format
  --follow-symlinks      # Follow symbolic links
  --include-hidden       # Include hidden files
  --exclude PATTERN      # Exclude patterns (glob)
```

### 2. Duplicate Files Search

**Goal**: Identify duplicate files based on content to reclaim storage space.

#### Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Content-Based Detection**
- Hash-based comparison using SHA-256
- Group files by hash
- Report duplicates with file paths and sizes

**Phase 2: Optimization**
- Size pre-filtering (only compare files of same size)
- Partial hash comparison (first N bytes) before full hash
- Parallel hashing for multiple files
- Progress indicator for long operations

**Phase 3: Interactive Management**
- Interactive mode to review and delete duplicates
- Auto-select duplicates based on rules (keep oldest/newest, by path priority)
- Dry-run mode to preview changes
- Safe delete with confirmation
- Option to create hard links instead of keeping copies

#### Technical Considerations

**Efficiency:**
- Multi-stage filtering:
  1. Group by size (instant, no I/O)
  2. Group by partial hash (first 8KB)
  3. Group by full hash (only for matches)
- Use `hashlib` with optimal buffer size (64KB-1MB chunks)
- Implement worker pool for parallel hashing
- Skip files smaller than a threshold (e.g., < 100 bytes)
- Add progress bars with ETA for user feedback
- Consider memory-mapped files for large files
- Database/cache for previously computed hashes

**Reusability:**
- Create `storage_tools/duplicates.py` module
- Classes:
  - `DuplicateFinder`: Main duplicate detection
  - `FileHasher`: Handle hashing with caching
  - `DuplicateGroup`: Represent a group of duplicate files
  - `DuplicateResolver`: Handle duplicate resolution strategies
- Separate detection from action (finding vs. deleting)
- Make hash algorithm configurable
- Plugin architecture for resolution strategies

**Caveats:**
- Handle permission errors when reading files
- Very large files may take time to hash (streaming hash required)
- Don't cross filesystem boundaries by default (option to enable)
- Handle files that change during scanning
- Be extremely careful with deletion operations
- Consider file metadata (preserve oldest/newest based on timestamps)
- Handle case-insensitive filesystems properly
- Zero-byte files should be handled separately
- Some files may be locked/in use
- Consider excluding system directories by default
- Empty files are technically duplicates but may not be worth reporting

**CLI Interface:**
```bash
storage-tools find-duplicates <path> [options]
  --min-size SIZE           # Minimum file size to consider
  --hash-algo {sha256,md5}  # Hash algorithm
  --interactive             # Interactive deletion mode
  --auto-select {oldest,newest,path-priority}
  --dry-run                 # Show what would be deleted
  --exclude PATTERN         # Exclude patterns
  --format {table,json}     # Output format
  --create-hardlinks        # Replace duplicates with hard links
  --threads N               # Number of parallel hash workers
```

### 3. Duplicate Folders Search

**Goal**: Find folders with identical or highly similar content.

#### Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Exact Folder Matching**
- Compare folders based on:
  - Same file count
  - Same total size
  - Same file structure (names and paths)
  - Same file contents (hash-based)
- Generate folder fingerprint (hash of sorted file hashes)

**Phase 2: Similar Folder Detection**
- Calculate similarity percentage
- Detect partial duplicates (folders with >X% same files)
- Find subset folders (one folder contains all files from another)
- Detect structure similarity (same structure, different content)

**Phase 3: Advanced Comparison**
- Ignore metadata (compare only content)
- Fuzzy name matching (similar but not identical names)
- Date-based comparison (same content, different timestamps)
- Size-based tolerance (allow small differences)

#### Technical Considerations

**Efficiency:**
- Quick rejection based on file count and total size
- Build folder signatures (merkle tree hash of contents)
- Use bloom filters for quick similarity checks
- Parallelize folder analysis
- Cache folder signatures for repeated comparisons
- Skip system folders and application bundles
- Incremental comparison (stop early if folders differ)

**Reusability:**
- Create `storage_tools/folder_duplicates.py` module
- Classes:
  - `FolderAnalyzer`: Analyze individual folders
  - `FolderComparator`: Compare two folders
  - `FolderSignature`: Folder fingerprint/hash
  - `SimilarityCalculator`: Calculate similarity metrics
  - `FolderMatcher`: Find matching folders in a set
- Reuse `FileHasher` from duplicate files module
- Abstract similarity algorithms for different strategies
- Make comparison criteria configurable

**Caveats:**
- Symbolic links can create complex scenarios
- Application bundles (.app on macOS) should be treated as single units
- Package directories (node_modules, venv) are often large and duplicated
- Consider excluding common duplicates (caches, builds, temp folders)
- Folder timestamps are less reliable than file timestamps
- Hidden files and folders need special consideration
- Cross-platform path separators
- Case sensitivity varies by OS
- Very large folders with millions of files are expensive to compare
- Partial folder copies may be intentional (backups)
- Some folders may share files via hard links

**CLI Interface:**
```bash
storage-tools find-duplicate-folders <path> [options]
  --min-similarity PERCENT  # Minimum similarity (0-100)
  --exact-only              # Only exact duplicates
  --include-subsets         # Include subset matches
  --min-files N             # Minimum file count
  --ignore-names            # Ignore filename differences
  --ignore-timestamps       # Ignore modification times
  --exclude PATTERN         # Exclude patterns
  --format {table,json}     # Output format
  --depth N                 # How deep to search
```

### 4. Large Files Search

**Goal**: Quickly identify the largest files consuming disk space.

#### Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Basic Large File Finding**
- Scan directory tree for files
- Track top N largest files
- Display with sizes and paths
- Sort by size (descending)

**Phase 2: Enhanced Filtering**
- Filter by file type/extension
- Filter by age (modified/accessed date)
- Filter by path pattern
- Group results by directory or extension
- Show both apparent size and actual disk usage

**Phase 3: Trend Analysis**
- Show recently created large files
- Show files that have grown recently
- Show largest files by directory
- Compare snapshots over time

#### Technical Considerations

**Efficiency:**
- Use heap/priority queue to maintain top N files (avoid sorting all)
- Use `os.stat()` to get file size without reading content
- Early termination if enough large files found
- Stream results (don't hold all files in memory)
- Consider using `du` command on Unix systems for disk usage
- Parallel directory traversal for speed
- Add size thresholds to skip small files early

**Reusability:**
- Create `storage_tools/large_files.py` module
- Classes:
  - `LargeFileFinder`: Main finding logic
  - `FileInfo`: Data class for file information
  - `SizeCalculator`: Handle different size types
  - `TopNTracker`: Efficient top-N tracking with heap
- Reuse traversal logic from analyzer module
- Separate finding from filtering and formatting
- Make size comparison pluggable (apparent vs. actual)

**Caveats:**
- Sparse files report apparent size vs. actual size
- Hard links may cause same file to appear multiple times
- Symbolic links should be handled carefully
- Files may grow/shrink during scan
- Permission issues on some files
- Different size reporting on different filesystems
- Compressed filesystems report different sizes
- Network drives may report sizes differently
- Some files may be deleted during scan
- Cache files and logs can be very large but less important
- Virtual machine disk images are often large
- Media files (videos) are typically large but expected

**CLI Interface:**
```bash
storage-tools find-large-files <path> [options]
  --top N                   # Show top N files (default: 20)
  --min-size SIZE           # Minimum size threshold
  --extension EXT           # Filter by extension
  --modified-since DATE     # Files modified after date
  --exclude PATTERN         # Exclude patterns
  --group-by {dir,ext}      # Group results
  --format {table,json,csv} # Output format
  --actual-size             # Use actual disk usage
  --include-hidden          # Include hidden files
```
